<b>Pizza Sales Analysis using Azure</b>

The project, "Pizza Sales Analysis using Azure," aims to solve the challenge of underutilized sales data within the pizza industry by creating an end-to-end data pipeline. Leveraging Azure services, it starts with automated data ingestion via Azure Data Factory, moving on-premises SQL data to Azure Storage. Azure Databricks then efficiently processes and aggregates the data, enabling the calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order. These KPIs provide business owner with valuable insights into their operations and customer behavior. Power BI is integrated to present these insights through interactive visualizations, empowering users to make data-driven decisions. This project addresses a clear need for data-driven decision-making in the pizza industry, fostering optimized operations, enhanced customer experiences, and increased profitability.
